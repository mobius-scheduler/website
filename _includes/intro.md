Mobius is a scheduling system for shared mobility platforms. It allocates
tasks from different customers to vehicles, for applications such as
food and package delivery, ridesharing, and mobile sensing. Mobius uses
guided optimization to achieve both _high throughput_ and _fairness_ across
customers. Mobius supports spatiotemporally-diverse and dynamic customer
demands, and provides a principled method to navigate inherent tradeoffs
between fairness and throughput caused by shared mobility.

Our evaluation demonstrates these properties---along with the versatitlity
and scalability of Mobius---using traces gathered from ridesharing and aerial
sensing applications. Our ridesharing case study shows that Mobius can
schedule more than 16,000 tasks across 40 customers and 200 vehicles in
an online manner.
